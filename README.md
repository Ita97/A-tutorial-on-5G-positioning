# A Tutorial on 5G Positioning - Code
This repository contains the Matlab code of the simulations provided in the article: "A Tutorial on 5G Positioning", which is currently under review at IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials.
A preview of the paper can be found here: [A Tutorial on 5G Positioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10551).
If you plan to use any portion of this code, please cite the corresponding paper.

Since we cannot provide the 3D indoor rendering, the code contained in this repository covers only the outdoor scenario provided in the tutorial (and shown below).
